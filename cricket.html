    <h1>Cricket</h1>
    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is
    a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on
    three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding
    bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite
    end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker,
    with the batting team scoring one run for each of these swaps. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary
    of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.</p>
    <p style="color: black;">The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are "out"). Dismissal can occur in various ways,
    including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side
    either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball
    before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings
    (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five
    days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each
    "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four
    hours.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 30px; ">Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement. Others
    include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games
    category[6]), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis.[7] In cricket's case, a key difference is the
    existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were
    herded), that the batter must defend.[8] The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball"
    games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in
    which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed
    at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it".[9]</p>

<h3>Beaconhouse Newlands</h3> <hr
<p>Beaconhouse Newlands is an IB school in lahore, Pakistan.Newlands Lahore (Newlands Lahore) was established on 13th September 2011, and takes pride in being the first
International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (IB PYP) authorised school in the private sector in Lahore and the
first in Beaconhouse School System. <br> <br> At Newlands Lahore, we create a premier day boarding experience for students, where
education is about learning, creating opportunities for learners to develop their own ideas, and letting them stretch
their imaginations. <hr> We have grown in numbers and in repute over the years, as a school of choice, as our learners step
into the practical world as innovators and inventors, ready to meet the challenges of the 21st century. As an authorised
IB World School , Newlands Lahore provides a comprehensive educational journey starting from the Primary Years Programme
(PYP) for young minds aged 3-11. This journey progresses through the dynamic Middle Years Programme (MYP) for ages 11-16
and culminates in the rigorous IB Diploma Programme for students aged 16-19. <hr
<p>M Armstrong is focussed upon further developing the wonderful culture that exists in the school, supporting students
both academically and also as developing individuals. He is committed to nurturing culturally diverse and responsible
global citizens in an inclusive learning community that combines core values with an inquiry-based curriculum.

He is committed to developing a modern and progressive approach to learning that is not just about memorising content,
as it is in many other schools, but that enables students to prepare for the modern world by enabling a deeper
understanding of concepts and the capacity to transfer learning to new contexts. The goal is that students are well
prepared for university entrance, either in Pakistan or in other countries around the world, able to show competence and
confidence in their chosen areas of specialisation and in general. Students will become confident and independent
individuals, people of integrity with the capacity for teamwork and leadership, able to develop a visionary sense of
their true potential and of how they can become better human beings.
